# 🐷 Word Piggy

Word Piggy is an open-source web application for analyzing word and phrase frequency in news media using the GDELT Project.

It allows users to:
- Search for one or more words or phrases
- Filter by region (Canada, United States, Europe)
- Choose a historical date range
- Compare terms over time using charts and tables

## Data Source
Word Piggy uses the GDELT 2.0 DOC API, which tracks global news coverage across thousands of outlets.

Important notes:
- Counts represent the number of matching articles, not word occurrences.
- Results may vary due to GDELT ingestion, deduplication, and query constraints.

## Status
This project is an early-stage experiment and is actively evolving.
